# Python-OSC-Command-Creator
python based program to send custom osc 


A program written in python that i am spontaneously working on. I was unsatisfied with touchosc and other like programs. figured if i had to do lua scripts to make buttons work I may as well write python code to do things i want. Working on the ability to add video sources as objects for video switching and preview/program windows. Working on faders and other object types. It is not a labor of love it is a labor of boredom. it currently does work and you can send custom osc commands by typing in value and creating button. middle click pulls up the ability to edit object and or delete it

preset commands are set for bitfocus companion's first 8 buttons

it currently only needs tkinter and py-osc but working on adding other dependencies so just look at what is imported for python script
